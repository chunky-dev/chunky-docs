!!! warning "Experimental"
    This plugin is in early beta state and does not support all Chunky features yet. Additionally, while this plugin is still available for download, as of now, it is not being actively supported or developed.

!!! info "Renderer switching in Chunky 2.4.0 or later"
    As of Chunky 2.4.0, renderer switching is supported. The <samp style="font-size: 1em;">ChunkyCLRenderer</samp> of the ChunkyCL plugin cannot yet be used in conjunction with the Denoising Plugin, although loading both plugins concurrently does not cause an exception anymore.

    Plugins which have not yet been updated to support the new `addRenderer` API feature (such as the <a href="https://github.com/llbit/Chunky-AOPlugin" target="_blank">Ambient Occlusion Plugin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/llbit/Chunky-DepthPlugin" target="_blank">Depth Buffer Plugin</a>) are still supported and are added with the name of <samp style="font-size: 1em;">PluginRenderer</samp>.

This plugin adds AI denoiser functionality using Intel Open Image Denoise. It is very effective at reducing noise and can be used to effectively cut render times greatly.

**Installation**

- Step 1: Download the correct release of the plugin from the GitHub repository for the version of Chunky on which you want the denoiser to run, and install it according to the plugin [installation instructions](../chunky_plugins#installation).

| Version        | Plugin Release | Plugin File                   |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Chunky 2.4+    | v0.4.0         | `chunky-denoiser.jar`         |
| Chunky 2.0-2.3 | v0.3.2         | `chunky-denoiser-chunky2.jar` |
| Chunky 1       | v0.3.2         | `chunky-denoiser-chunky1.jar` |

- Step 2: Download the <a href="https://www.openimagedenoise.org/downloads.html" target="_blank">Precompiled Intel Open Image Denoise Binary Packages</a> for your OS. (for example, on Windows, it would be "oidn-1.4.3.x64.vc14.windows.zip".)

- Step 3: Extract the OIDN ZIP file to a safe location on your computer, such as "C:\Program Files\oidn-1.4.3.x64.vc14.windows". Alternatively, you may optionally extract only "oidnDenoise.exe", "OpenImageDenoise.dll", and "tbb12.dll" to that chosen safe location. These are the minimum required files at the time of writing.

- Step 4: Launch Chunky.

- Step 5: Open the <samp>Denoiser</samp> tab in the left control panel.

- Step 6: Click the <samp>...</samp> button, and then browse for "oidnDenoise.exe", which is typically located in the "bin" folder of the extracted OIDN ZIP file.

This plugin adds more octree implementations with a range of uses and benefits. See the GitHub repository for more information and on the different octree implementations and their uses. Notable implementations include those listed below.

- Disk Implementation: This implementation caches the octree to disk. It is extremely slow compared to other octree implementations, but it bypasses memory limits when loading large chunk selections.

- Garbage-collected Implementation: This implementation is generally faster during octree creation and octree loading. The peak memory usage of this implementation is higher, however.

- Dictionary Implementation: This implementation uses less memory than PACKED does. It is slightly slower while rendering and loading, however.

- Small DAG Implementation: This implementation uses even less memory than DICTIONARY does. It is slightly slower while rendering and loading, however.

One more option is available but is not listed here. Further information is located in the <a href="https://github.com/aTom3333/chunky-octree-plugin" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
