# Scene Format

## Scene Description Format (SDF)

Most of the settings in Chunky scenes are stored in Scene Description files using a JSON-based file format. This page documents the SDF file format. The documentation is currently incomplete, and may lag behind the current Chunky version as new versions are released. Check the version history at the end of this page to see the latest updates made to the SDF documentation.

SDF JSON files are stored in the scene directory and the filename is based on the scene name with `.json` appended. For example, the JSON file for a scene named `MyScene` would be `MyScene.json`.
