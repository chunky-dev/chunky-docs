# Chunky

![Overview](../img/user_interface/overview.png)

Chunky's UI is built using JavaFX and is seperated into three panes which can be slide to increase/decrease screenspace of the different components. These panes often have tabs which contain addtional controls. There are three main panes; The left pane handles Render Controls (to be covered on a seperate page), the middle pane is for previews (both 2D and 3D), and the right pane is for general options.

## Map

![Overview](../img/user_interface/map.png)

Chunky displays an overhead 2D view of your world within the center pane under the `Map` tab, highlighted in red in the above image, and should be the default view when you launch Chunky. While this view can be used for mapping purposes it's primarily used for making chunk selections for renders much easier. There are two available modes for the Map; At (map) `Scale` 13 or greater you will be shown individual blocks and for a `Scale` of 12 or under you will be displayed a biome view.
