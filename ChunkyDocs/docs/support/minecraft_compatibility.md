# Minecraft Compatibility

Bedrock Edition worlds are currently not supported; however, they can be converted to Java Edition format by using <a href="https://chunker.app/" target="_blank">Chunker</a>, by Hive Games. Most entities are currently not rendered by Chunky, and some special blocks cannot be rendered either.

Below is a list of the Minecraft versions currently supported by Chunky and everything that Chunky currently cannot render. For more detailed information about which features of Minecraft are not yet supported, check the <a href="https://github.com/chunky-dev/chunky/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aminecraft" target="_blank">issues with the "minecraft" label</a> on GitHub.
