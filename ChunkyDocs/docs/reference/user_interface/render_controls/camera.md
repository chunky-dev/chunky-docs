## Controls

- `Load preset`: Dropdown menu to select a camera preset to load for the selected camera.

    - <img src="../../../../img/user_interface/render_controls/iso-nw.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"> `Isometric West-North (North-West)`: Sets the `Projection mode` of the selected camera to `Parallel`, and points the camera North-West with an altitude angle of 45 degrees below the horizon. 

    - <img src="../../../../img/user_interface/render_controls/iso-ne.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"> `Isometric North-East`: Sets the `Projection mode` of the selected camera to `Parallel`, and points the camera North-East with an altitude angle of 45 degrees below the horizon. 

    - <img src="../../../../img/user_interface/render_controls/iso-se.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"> `Isometric East-South (South-East)`: Sets the `Projection mode` of the selected camera to `Parallel`, and points the camera South-East with an altitude angle of 45 degrees below the horizon. 

    - <img src="../../../../img/user_interface/render_controls/iso-sw.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"> `Isometric South-West`: Sets the `Projection mode` of the selected camera to `Parallel`, and points the camera South-West with an altitude angle of 45 degrees below the horizon. 

    - <img src="../../../../img/user_interface/render_controls/skybox-right.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"> `Skybox Right`: Sets the `Projection mode` of the selected camera to `Standard`, sets the camera `Field of View (zoom)` to *90*, and points the camera East.

    - <img src="../../../../img/user_interface/render_controls/skybox-left.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"> `Skybox Left`: Sets the `Projection mode` of the selected camera to `Standard`, sets the camera `Field of View (zoom)` to *90*, and points the camera West.

    - <img src="../../../../img/user_interface/render_controls/skybox-up.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"> `Skybox Up`: Sets the `Projection mode` of the selected camera to `Standard`, sets the camera `Field of View (zoom)` to *90*, and points the camera upward, with North being at the bottom of the frame.

    - <img src="../../../../img/user_interface/render_controls/skybox-down.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"> `Skybox Down`: Sets the `Projection mode` of the selected camera to `Standard`, sets the camera `Field of View (zoom)` to *90*, and points the camera downward, with South being at the bottom of the frame.

    - <img src="../../../../img/user_interface/render_controls/skybox-front.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"> `Skybox Front (North)`: Sets the `Projection mode` of the selected camera to `Standard`, sets the camera `Field of View (zoom)` to *90*, and points the camera North.

    - <img src="../../../../img/user_interface/render_controls/skybox-back.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"> `Skybox Back`: Sets the `Projection mode` of the selected camera to `Standard`, sets the camera `Field of View (zoom)` to *90*, and points the camera South.

- `Camera`: Input field to set a name for the current camera. By clicking the button immediately to the right of the input field, a dropdown menu containing a list of all named cameras can be accessed. A camera can be switched to by clicking on its list entry.

- `Clone`: Creates a copy of the currently-selected camera.

- `Remove`: Removes the currently-selected camera from the list.

---

- `Position & Orientation`: Collapsible panel that contains controls to change the position, orientation, and lens shift of the selected camera.

    - `Position`: Each input field on this row changes the X, Y, or Z coordinate of the selected camera, respectively.

    - `Orientation`: Each input field on this row changes the yaw, pitch, or roll of the selected camera, respectively, in degrees.

    - `Lens shift`: Each input field on this row changes the horizontal lens shift or the vertical lens shift of the selected camera, respectively. <a href="https://jackjt8.github.io/ChunkyGuide/docs/advanced_techniques/lenseshift.html" target="_blank">Lens shift</a> is relative to the canvas height.

{% if extra.chunky < 2_05_00 %}
- `Camera to player`: Moves the selected camera to the location of one of the players, if loaded. "Which one? No clue."
{% endif %}

- `Center camera`: Moves the selected camera to the center of the loaded chunks.

---

- `Projection mode`: Dropdown menu to select the camera projection type for the selected camera. [Figure 3.2.15.2](#figure-3-2-15-2) shows a comparison of the different camera projection modes.

    - `Standard`: Sets the selected camera to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera" target="_blank">pinhole projection</a>, which is similar to how many cameras work, and is how Minecraft works.

    - `Parallel`: Sets the selected camera to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_projection" target="_blank">parallel projection</a>, in which the camera is infinitely distant from the scene, and has an infinite focal length (zoom). This causes parallel lines in the three-dimensional scene to remain parallel in the two-dimensional image, which causes all blocks to appear the same size, regardless of "distance" from the camera.

    - `Fisheye`: Sets the selected camera to use full-frame <a href="https://wiki.panotools.org/Fisheye_Projection" target="_blank">fisheye projection</a>, which maps a portion of the surface of a sphere to a two-dimensional image.

    - `Stereographic`: Sets the selected camera to use <a href="https://wiki.panotools.org/Stereographic_Projection" target="_blank">stereographic projection</a>, which is an alternative to fisheye projection that has less distortion at the edges of the image.

    - `Panoramic (equirectangular)`: Sets the selected camera to use <a href="https://wiki.panotools.org/Equirectangular_Projection" target="_blank">equirectangular projection</a>, which maps a portion of the surface of a sphere to a two-dimensional image, transforming spherical coordinates into planar coordinates.

    - `Panoramic (slot)`: Sets the selected camera to use slot panoramic projection, which behaves like a pinhole camera in the vertical direction, and like a fisheye camera in the horizontal direction.

    - `Omni-directional Stereo (left eye)`: Sets the selected camera to use omni-directional stereo projection, which is identical to equirectangular projection, but with interpupillary distance factored in, to create distinct images for viewing on a VR system. This mode creates an image to be viewed by the left eye.

    - `Omni-directional Stereo (right eye)`: Sets the selected camera to use omni-directional stereo projection. This mode creates an image to be viewed by the right eye.

- `Field of view (zoom)`: Changes the vertical field of view of the selected camera. Positive values beyond the range of the slider can be entered into the associated input field.

- `Depth of field`: Changes the <a href="https://www.nfi.edu/depth-of-field/" target="_blank">depth of field</a>, measured in centimeters (100 centimeters = 1 meter = 1 block), of the selected camera.

- `Subject distance`: Changes the distance to the focus point, measured in meters (blocks), of the selected camera. Only effective when `Depth of field` is not set to *infinity*.

- `Autofocus`: Focuses the selected camera on the set target by setting the `Subject distance` to the distance to the set target and setting the `Depth of field` to the one hundredth of the square of the distance to the set target.

### 2.5.0 Snapshot controls

The `Camera` tab was improved in [Chunky 2.5.0 snapshots](../../../../getting_started/configuring_chunky_launcher#advanced-settings).
