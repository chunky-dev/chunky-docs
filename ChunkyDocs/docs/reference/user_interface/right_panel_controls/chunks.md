## Controls

- `Clear selection`: Clears the map view chunk selection.

- `Export chunks to ZIP`: Opens a 'Save As' dialog box to export the selected chunks as region files containing the chunks to a ZIP archive.

- `Export view to PNG`: Opens a 'Save As' dialog box to export the current map view as a PNG file.

- `Delete selected chunks`: Displays a confirmation prompt for the user to delete the selected chunks from the currently-loaded world. (Chunks can be re-generated by Minecraft, but all user-created data in the chunks will be lost. It is a good idea to keep a backup of your world before performing this action.)
