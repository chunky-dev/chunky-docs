## Controls

- `Clear selection`: Clears the map view chunk selection.

- `Export chunks to ZIP`: Opens a 'Save As' dialog box to export the selected chunks as region files containing the chunks to a .ZIP archive.

- `Export view to PNG`: Opens a 'Save As' dialog box to export the current map view as a PNG file.

- `Delete selected chunks`: Displays a confirmation prompt for the user to delete the selected chunks from the currently-loaded world. (Chunks can be re-generated by Minecraft, but all user-created data in the chunks will be lost. It is a good idea to keep a backup of your world before performing this action.)

### 2.5.0 Snapshot Controls

The Chunky GUI was improved and reorganized in the [Chunky 2.5.0 snapshots](../../../../getting_started/configuring_chunky_launcher#advanced-settings).

The `Chunks` tab was removed from the right control panel, and its controls were relocated to other places.

- `Clear selection`: This control was removed, but an identical control exists in the [`Map` tab right-click menu](../../map#right-click-menu).

- `Export chunks to ZIP`: This control was relocated to the [`Map` tab right-click menu](../../map#250-snapshot-controls) and renamed to `Export selected chunks...`.

- `Export view to PNG`: This control was relocated to the [`Map` tab right-click menu](../../map#250-snapshot-controls) and renamed to `Save map view as...`.

- `Delete selected chunks`: This control was relocated to the [`Map` tab right-click menu](../../map#250-snapshot-controls).
