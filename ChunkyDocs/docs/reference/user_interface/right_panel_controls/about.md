### 2.5.0 Snapshot Controls

The Chunky GUI was improved and reorganized in the [Chunky 2.5.0 snapshots](../../../../getting_started/configuring_chunky_launcher#advanced-settings).

The `About` tab was removed from the right control panel, and its contents were relocated to other places.

- `View Credits`: This control was relocated to the menu bar, under the [`Help`](../../menu_bar/help) dropdown menu, and renamed to `About`.
