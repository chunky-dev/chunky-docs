# Chunky GUI

---

The GUI of Chunky is built using JavaFX and is separated into three panels which can be resized. These panels have tabs which contain additional controls. The control panel on the left contains render controls, the control panel in the middle contains the world map view and the render preview, and the control panel on the right contains general controls. In addition, scene management controls are at the top of the window, and render progress controls are at the bottom of the window, along with a progress bar.

## 2.5.0 Snapshot Controls

The Chunky GUI was heavily improved in the [Chunky 2.5.0 snapshots](../../../getting_started/configuring_chunky_launcher#advanced-settings). Many controls have been reorganized.

The control panel on the left still contains render controls, the control panel in the middle still contains the world map view and the render preview, but many controls that had been in the right control panel have been removed into other places, and the right control panel has become part of the [`Map`](../map) tab, and contains only map view controls. Scene management controls have been organized into a dropdown menu.
